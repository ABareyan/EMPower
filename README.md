The issues we have noticed in the employee/employer industries are:
# Too many job sites
#Too many job seekers

But…
There is not a single platform where employees search for the jobs and employers post what they are looking for

## Our Mission

JUST LIKE THAT …
Building a middle ground between people who are actively looking for jobs and employers who are having difficulties finding competitive employee

## Possible Solution

# Job Seekers
Job seekers look into our database to see available positions and compensation.
If the type of job and compensation they are looking for matches with employers need, we will display the available jobs
If they can’t find the type of jobs, they can post themselves what type of jobs they are looking for and anticipated compensation

# Employers
Employers can directly post what type of employees they are hiring
If there’s already profile set by the job seekers, employer can contact them

## Future Plans
Allow employers to be able to mark already hired post as ‘Hired’ and post automatically deleted
Allow employees to update their posting and/or edit whatever they have submitted. Allow them to mark their posting as ‘Employed’ and post automatically deleted
Link jobs from online like Indeed.com and/or LinkedIn etc
Increase revenue by advertisement
Once we have enough resources, maybe plan on implementing this web app internationally
